# IoT Monitor

I'm trying to monitor a whole bunch of "IoT" devices (some are not actually that, but I just threw them in here nonetheless). Still needs to be run as a service and actually send out notifications.

The devices.csv serves as a "database" for now, should probably be replaced with an actual DB eventually.
